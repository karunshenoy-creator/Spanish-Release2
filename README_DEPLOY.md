# Rutas y Palabras — Netlify-Ready Package

## One‑Step Deploy (Netlify Drop)
1) Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2) Drag & drop the contents of this folder (or just upload the ZIP as-is).
3) Netlify will give you a URL like `https://your-site-name.netlify.app` immediately.
4) On your iPhone: open the URL in Safari → Share → **Add to Home Screen**.

## Notes
- This package includes a web manifest and iOS "Add to Home Screen" meta tags for a standalone, full‑screen experience.
- If your app uses client-side routing, uncomment the redirect rule in `netlify.toml`.
